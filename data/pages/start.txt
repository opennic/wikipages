===== About OpenNIC =====
OpenNIC (also referred to as the OpenNIC Project) is a user owned and controlled top-level Network Information Center offering a non-national alternative to traditional Top-Level Domain (TLD) registries; such as ICANN.

Use of OpenNIC DNS servers, enables host name resolution in the Legacy U.S. Government DNS, OpenNIC operated namespaces, and namespaces the OpenNIC has peering agreements with.

===== This Wiki =====
This wiki is a limited access work area for OpenNIC documentation and other related content. In accordance with OpenNICs philosophy, all notes and documents are world-readable. Write access is restricted to participants relevant for this specific project; to provide quality content and have cross-verification by other members.

===== How you can help =====
The main thing anyone can do to help, is to **become a member**. Sign up [[https://members.opennicproject.org/|here]] and **join our [[opennic:mailinglist|mailing list]]**! The other great thing you can do to help, is to **spread the word**, even if you do not use our TLDs, our DNS network is still the quickest around!

**Contributions to the OpenNIC Wiki** are welcomed. There is a lot to do: missing information needs to be added, articles need to be cleaned and rewritten, and other things. If you are willing to donate your time, as contributions to the OpenNIC Wiki, you can do this with four simple steps:
  - Sign up at https://members.opennicproject.org/
  - Log in (with the username and password you chose during sign up) at https://wiki.opennic.org/start?do=login&sectok=
  - Start writing articles or update existing articles. Currently, there are no guidelines in place for writing articles.  Feel free to design effective pages, conveying information clearly.
  - Happy editing and a big thank you from the OpenNIC team!
