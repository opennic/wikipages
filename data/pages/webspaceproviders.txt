====== OpenNIC Compatible Webspace Providers ======
===== Requirements for listing =====
  * Provider needs to accept free or paid sign-ups using an automated or semi-automated sign-up form, no closed/invite-only groups
  * Paid-only providers need to have "paid-only" included in the notes section
  * Providers should not require manual server-side setup, things should work "out of the box"
