====== OpenNIC Compatible Webspace Providers ======
===== Requirements for listing =====
  * Provider needs to accept free or paid sign-ups using an automated or semi-automated sign-up form, no closed/invite-only groups
  * Paid-only providers need to have "paid-only" included in the notes section
  * Providers should not require manual server-side setup, things should work "out of the box"

| Tested at [[https://interserver.net| Interserver.net]], should work as well with any CPanel hosting | [[http://libre.libre|2019-04-29]] by [[/user/antihierarchic]] | Interserver.net itself doesn't allow to create non-ICANN domains through its own DNS manager, but: log into CPanel - add Domain (A record is created, check CPanel Zone editor), then add this A record for the domain in OpenNic registration panel - tested and works with be.libre (.dyn, .geek, .gopher, .indy, .libre, .oss, .parody -all exept .pirate - don't know why) |
